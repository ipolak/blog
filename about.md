"Never discuss religion or politics" has been conventional social wisdom for well over a century, and to that short list I might add science.
Bring up one or more of these three topics in general company and you're sure to offend somebody!
Being connected to so many of our friends, colleagues, and family on social media only seems to have compounded the problem.

I personally have fairly eclectic views on these topics.
I was born, raised, and continue to live as an active [Latter-day Saint](https://www.lds.org).
I enjoy a career as an academic scientist in the USA, and over the years my political views have taken on a distinct libertarian bent.
My libertarian leanings make me an oddball in the company of both my family and my colleagues (although for different reasons).
Some libertarians might find it odd or hypocritical for me to proclaim support for principles of economic liberty and small government and yet to seek and accept federal grants to fund my research in academic science.
And many of my fellow Christians are very skeptical of all things scientific&mdash;or at least those scientific findings that don't seem to agree nicely with their preconceived notions of life and the universe.

So how do I resolve these apparent inconsistencies?
How do I live with myself when at times my faith, political views, and scientific reasoning pull me in different directions?
I don't know if I have a good answer for that question...yet.
Thus, this blog was born!

What I *do know* is that my faith, my political views, and science all play and important role in my life.
I have no scientific proof that Jesus Christ lives or that he is the savior of the world, but does that make the spiritual experiences I have had less real or meaningful?
Love, hope, compassion, and trust cannot be subjected to precise measurement or empirical analysis, and yet they remain among the most powerful forces for good in the world.
On the other hand, I treasure science as mankind's framework for exploring and understanding the physical universe in which we live.
In an age when technology enables anyone to distribute information to billions with little to no effort or cost, the value of scientific reasoning and objective appeals to evidence have never been more important to society's ability to distinguish fact from fad and fantasy.
Finally, I wholeheartedly believe in the sanctity of personal liberties, and in confining the scope of government to the protection of those liberties.
Not only is this the best cure for many of the social and economic problems we have as a nation, it is the only responsibility for which government can stake a moral claim.

So enter if you dare, and come along with me as I wade through my cognitive dissonance and explore these topics *In Pursuit of Light and Knowledge*!
