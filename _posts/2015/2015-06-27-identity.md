The recent revelation that [Rachel Dolezal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal), (former) president of the Spokane NAACP chapter, is not in fact African American has created quite a stir in the media.
Born a blonde-haired blue-eyed Montana girl, Rachel pursued education and a career in African American art, history, and culture, taking her to such places as Mississippi, Washington D.C., Idaho, and Washington state.
Somewhere along the way, she began claiming African American heritage, and (I presume) through hair and makeup styling was able to pass it off.
As the story unfolded regarding the controversy around her career, her family disputes, and fabrications in her biography, the one constant theme that stuck out to me was the claim that she *self-identified* as black.

Also prominent in the media spotlight recently has been [Caitlyn Jenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner), a former college football player who was later propelled to international fame by winning the gold medal in the 1976 Olympic men's decathlon.
Born as Bruce Jenner, Jenner claims to have struggled with gender identity from an early age, and engaged in cross-dressing and hormone replacement surgery for many years.
In spring of 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman on network television, and was soon featured on the cover of *Vanity Fair* magazine with the headline *"Call me Caitlyn"*.

In light of these and other current events, I've been reflecting frequently on the question of identity.
*What is our identity?*
I think most people will agree that who we are and who we can become is influenced heavily both by a variety of factors: some intrinsic and others extrinsic; some within our control and others beyond our control.
There may be some aspects of our family tradition, cultural heritage, personality, or creative talents that make us proud of who we are and where we've come from.
There may also be some aspects that don't make us proud, that we don't identify with, and from which we want to distance ourselves.
Having the liberty to choose who we are and who we will become is one of the most fundamental rights we can claim as human beings&mdash;a God-given right the precedes and transcends governments and cultures.

That said, I think it's important that we as a society acknowledge the fact that some aspects of individual identity are beyond our control.
If a man or woman struggles with gender identity, what is to be gained by declaring oneself trans-gender?
With the exception of some rare genetic anomalies, a person's gender is a biological fact that is not subject to interpretation.
That person's personality may not fit society's (often misguided) ideas of what a person of that gender should be like, or that person may experience feelings of sexual attraction to others of the same gender or multiple genders.
But personality, psychology, sexual orientation, or even sex reassignment surgery cannot change the fact of the person's biological gender.
(To be clear: I don't raise this question to ridicule or spark controversy, I am genuinely concerned about what individuals and society have to gain from claims of trans-gender identity.
It almost feels like questions like this are "off-limits" and that even bringing it up is a sign of intolerance and bigotry, but it's important for people with any opinion to facilitate civilized discussion of these sensitive issues.)

Perhaps a woman struggles with her weight and fitness, and is borderline obese.
Perhaps she excelled at sports in high school and enjoys a relatively active lifestyle, but her career now makes it difficult to find time for serious exercise and cooking nutritious meals for herself.
Can she declare herself perfectly healthy because she doesn't *identify* with being overweight?
Most would likely agree that such a claim is ineffectual at best, and harmful at worst.
If she were indeed committed to losing weight and improving her fitness, she would do best to focus on what she can control (exercise and nutrition) and not worry about the factors beyond her control (genetics).

I recently read [an excellent article by Nurideen Knight](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15108/), which in my opinion makes some very good points on the issue.

> The famous Toni Morrison book, The Bluest Eye, parallels this idea. The main character, Pecola, is a dark-skinned girl who desperately wants blue eyes. By the end of the story, she has blue eyes—or at least, she believes that she does. We, as the readers, don’t applaud this. In fact, by the end of the novel, we think Pecola has lost her mind. We know that it’s not really blue eyes she wants, she wants something much deeper—love, acceptance, respect, honor . . . the intangible human desires we all crave but are not equally given. We know that she has not received this, but instead is a victim of perpetual abuse, and there is no easy solution to her problems.
>
> But what if it were really possible for me to become white or for Pecola to acquire blue eyes? Would that be the end of the story—the happily ever after? Would changing our physical appearance magically erase all our issues of self-esteem and self-worth?
>
> No, of course not. The eyes and the skin color were never the problem: racism and abuse were. We would only be putting a Band-Aid on the real issue. The many men and women who “passed” as white during America’s shameful Jim Crow era may have gained the social privileges bestowed by being white, but they also lost their heritage, their family ties, and their integrity, thanks to the lie they were forced to tell every single day.

How much are gender identity issues the result of society's narrow intepretations of what it means to be masculine or feminine?
How much are race identity issues the result of racism that, despite immense progress over the years, remains a significant issue in our society?
Are individual declarations of trans-gender and trans-racial identity simply putting a Band-Aid on the gaping wound of what is primarily a problem with our society?
Nurideen's article has many other gems in it, but rather than pasting the whole thing here I would simply encourage you to follow the link above and read the article.

I recently saw this photo on the [Humans of New York Facebook feed](https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork), the caption of which I also feel is relevant.

[![A Gay Human of New York](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t31.0-8/p480x480/1912130_609911422416295_2102048223_o.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/609911422416295/?type=1&theater)

> I know this isn't going to be a popular opinion, but I'm gay, and I don't think there's nearly as much discrimination as people claim. Don't get me wrong, I've experienced discrimination. But it hasn't been a huge factor in my life. I feel like a lot of people bring discrimination on themselves by getting in people's faces too much. They like to say: 'Accept me or else!' They go around demanding respect as a member of a group, instead of earning respect as an individual. And that sort of behavior invites discrimination. I've never demanded respect because I was gay, and I haven't experienced much discrimination when people find out that I am.

Perhaps for many the issue of identity is a matter of respect, and claims of trans-gender or trans-racial identity are simply a cry to be accepted and respected for that person's individual worth.
I think we as a society can be much better about showing respect and civility toward others, especially those different from us or with whom we disagree on particular issues.
But I also think this man's words are wise.
Beyond the common courtesy and respect owed us as a human being, the real, deep respect we all seek&mdash;for us *as an individual*&mdash;must be earned by us as an individual, and not because we happen to identify with a particular group or set of groups.
Our ethnic heritage, our sexuality, our personality, and our interests contribute to our identity, but they are not our life.
They are just part of it.
