The Internet is full of blogs that have one entry a year for the last six years, half of the entries containing little more than an apology for not posting more often.
I hope I have the time to update this blog consistently&mdash;if not frequently&mdash;but regardless of what happens, I promise this will not become one of *those* blogs.
I guess starting things off meta-style with a post about the blog itself isn't a great start...
